## Prerequisites

### Step 1 - Required - Update Your Testbed

Update the /testbed/Serial_Sultan_testbed.yaml file
there are placeholders for the following platforms, which have all been tested:

    IOS:

        2960

        3560

        3750

        6500

        ISR 891FW

    IOS-XE:

        3850

        9300

        4500

        ISR 4400

    NXOS:

        Nexus 9k

        Nexus 7k

        Nexus 5k

        Nexus 2k FEX

Simply move your existing pyATS testbed devices into this file or complete the following appropriate to your inventory

```yaml
devices:
    6500:
      alias: '6500'
      type: 'router'

```

### Step 2 - Required - Obtain Your Cisco Serial 2 Info REST API Credentials 

[Cisco Support APIs](https://developer.cisco.com/site/support-apis/)

* Bug information
* TAC case information
* End-of-X information
* Product information
* RMA information
* Software Suggestion (Gold Star)
* Serial 2 Infomation

Click the Smart Net Total Care (SNTC) Link

![SNTC](images/06_SNTC.PNG)

Follow the OnBoarding process to get access to SNTC

![OnBoarding](images/06_onboard.PNG)

Optional - Read the Serial 2 Info REST API documentation

![Documentation](images/06_sn2i.PNG)

In the Cisco API Console in the main Apps & Keys page

![AppsAndKeys](images/06_appsandkeys.PNG)

Register a new app

Give it a name and description

* Important - make sure you select Client Credentials

![Register](images/06_newapp.PNG)

Select the Serial 2 Info API

* Note that out of the box Serial Sultan can handle up to 1,000 unique serial numbers per 24 hours

* If you have more devices / parts than this you can register individual Applications per-group of devices

* You can work with me or refactor the code to send different API credentials per-group of devices if scaling becomes an issue

![Select API](images/06_api.PNG)

Update the api_credentials/cisco_serial2info.yaml file with your client key and secret

```yaml
APIs:
  serial_2_info:
    serial_2_info_api_username: {{ your client key here }}
    serial_2_info_api_password: {{ your secret here }}
```

### Step 3 - Optional - F5

If you have F5 with the REST API enabled you can also capture the SFP and platform serial numbers with Serial Sultan ! 

Simply update the testbed/Serial_Sultan_f5_testbed.yaml file with the F5 IP address and REST API username and password. Add as many F5 platforms as you like!

```yaml
devices:
    F5:
      alias: 'F5'
      type: 'F5'
      os: 'BIGIP'
      platform: i2600
      credentials:
        default:
          username: {{ F5 API Username }}
          password: {{ F5 API Password}}
      connections:        
          ip: "{{ F5 REST API IP Address }}"
```

* IMPORTANT 

If you do *not* have any F5 devices *delete or rename* the testbed/Serial_Sultan_f5_testbed.yaml file before you run the job!

### Step 4 - Optional - SharePoint

Serial Sultan can automatically POST the CSV files into a SharePoint document library!

Simply update the api_credentials/sharepoint.yaml file with your environment information (domain, Sharepoint URL, username, password)

```yaml
APIs:
  inventory:
    sharePointUrl: 'https://{{ mydomain.com }}'
    folderUrl: '/Inventory'
    sharePointFileName: "Inventory/Inventory.csv"
    uploadFileName: "Inventory.csv"
    sharepoint_domain: mydomain
    sharepoint_user: {{ domain_user_name }}
    sharepoint_password: {{ domain_password }}
  contracts:
    sharePointUrl: 'https://{{ mydomain.com }}'
    folderUrl: '/Inventory'
    sharePointFileName: "Inventory/Contracts.csv"
    uploadFileName: "Contracts.csv"
    sharepoint_domain: mydomain
    sharepoint_user: {{ domain_user_name }}
    sharepoint_password: {{ domain_password }}
```

* IMPORTANT 

If you do *not* have a Sharepoint document library *delete or rename* the api_credentials/sharepoint.yaml file before you run the job

# You are ready to run Serial Sultan

You will also need Python 3, pip, and venv installed on your host system.

In your project directory, create your virtual environment

```console
python3 -m venv env
```

Activate (use) your new virtual environment (Linux):

```console
source env/bin/activate
```

Download or clone the Magic Carpet repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/automateyournetwork/magic_carpet
```

Install pyATS, Rich, markmap, netjsongraph, xmltodict and TinyDB into your environment:

```console
pip install pyats[full]
```

```console
pip install rich
```

```console
pip install xmltodict
```

```console
pip install tinydb
```

```console
sudo apt update
sudo apt install npm
sudo npm install markmap-cli -g
npm install netjsongraph.js --save
```

---
If you run into any installation issues with pyATS, please see the installation guide here: <https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-getting-started/docs/install/installpyATS.html>

---

When you are finished with your Magic Carpet session, enter the `deactivate` command to exit the python virtual environment.

Ensure SSH connectivity at from your host's CLI, and run the pyATS job:

```console
pyats run job Serial_Sultan_job.py --testbed-file testbed/Serial_Sultan_testbed.yaml
```

As with all my code I did my very best to test this across the board and at scale. I am always here to try and help - just open an Issue if you encounter any problems or reach out to me on Twitter @john_capobianco
